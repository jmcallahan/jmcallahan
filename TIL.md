 ## New to me:
  - Learned to code collapsible content in .md files. I'm super stoked for more formatting options there!

  - Updated README.md to better showcase myself professionally.
    
  - Dice.com is actually a clean, easy to navigate site for job hunting.

## Lab Work:
  - Downloaded and installed VMware Workstation Pro as well as relevant VMs and Kali Linux
  
## Issues I stumbled on:
  - Created a wordpress blog. Seems redundant to documents like this

## Results:
  - Better professional appearance across LinkedIn, Dice.com, Bluesky, and GitHub.

## Additional Notes:
  - Created new Bluesky account to coincide with professional goals.

  - Curious about efficacy of having a blog, bluesky, GitHub, and LinkedIn will impact visibility to potential employers, collaborators, or potential mentors.
