## 📝 About Me

I'm a Navy veteran and former operations leader at Rivian Automotive executing a structured transition into cybersecurity and IT infrastructure. My background in high-stakes operational environments (Navy navigation/force protection, emergency medicine, manufacturing operations) has built the foundation for security-focused technical work: incident response, systems thinking, risk assessment, and process-driven troubleshooting.

🔎 **Current Focus:**
- Building an enterprise-grade home lab for hands-on cybersecurity training
- Pursuing aggressive certification timeline (4 certs by April 2026)
- Formal IT education: MyComputerCareer (Jan 2026 start) + B.A.A.S. Cybersecurity (EIU, May 2027 completion)
- Targeting entry-level roles: SOC Analyst (Tier 1), IT Support, Help Desk

## 💡 Why Cybersecurity?

My career has been built around high-stakes operational environments where failure isn't an option:
- In the Navy, I operated in threat environments where security protocols were life-or-death.
- In emergency medicine, I managed critical systems where downtime meant patient harm.
- In manufacturing operations, I led process improvements that saved millions while maintaining safety and compliance.

Cybersecurity combines everything I've trained for: risk assessment, incident response, systems thinking, and the discipline to operate under pressure while following documented procedures. This isn't a career change—it's a redeployment of skills into a domain where they're mission-critical.
