### Hi there 👋 I'm Jason. Some friends call me J7, some call me J. All three are fine with me.


##### As of today, 6/29/25, I'm pretty new to coding and developing, but taking a dive at 40-something into a new path. 😰
##### That said, I'm excited to learn and develop some new skills.
##### My end goal is Cybersecurity and DevSecOps positions, and I'm hoping that I learn lots of great tips from everyone out there. 
### But I'm looking forward to the wild journey ahead!
  
##### 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics of GitHub and Coding in general, and starting on freeCodeCamp.org to get a foundation.
##### 🤔 I’m looking for help with where to start and gain a solid foundation. I know repetition and unrelenting drive to keep at it is one of the most important things. 
- Any tips you have to make the journey easier, or games, resources, or anything really to help make it all easier and fun to learn would be stellar.

##### 💬 Ask me about food. I worked as a chef for 5 years and have a **deep**, profound love of *spicy* foods. Mexican dishes like tacos de carnitas are among my **favorite**.
###  
##### ⚡ Fun fact: I love making music, and have been playing guitar since I was 13, and also dabble in other instruments like bass, drums, and keyboard/piano.
